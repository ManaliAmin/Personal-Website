            <h3>HTML5</h3>
            <p>    Humans can tell the different content apart, but machines can't — the browser doesn't see the different divs as header, footer, etc. It sees them as different divs. Wouldn't it be more useful if browsers and screen readers were able to explicitly identify say, the navigation menu so a visually impaired user could find it more easily, or the different news items on a bunch of blogs so they could be easily syndicated in an RSS feed without any extra programming?</p>
           
            <p> Even if you do use extra code to solve some of these problems, you can still only do it reliably for your web sites, as different web developers will use different class and ID names, especially when you consider the international audience — different web developers in different countries will use different languages to write their class and id names.
            </p>
            <dl>
               <dt>&lt;header&gt; &amp; &lt;footer&gt;:</dt>
                 <dd>The purpose of the &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; elements is to wrap header and footer content, respectively. In our particular example the &lt;header&gt; element contains a logo image, and the &lt;footer&gt; element contains a copyright notice, but you could add more elaborate content if you wished. Also note that you can have more than one header and footer on each page - as well as the top level header and footer we have just discussed, you could also have a &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; element nested inside each &lt;article&gt;</dd>
               <dt>&lt;section&gt;:</dt>
               <dd>The &lt;section&gt; element is for containing distinct different areas of functionality or subjects area, or breaking an article or story up into different sections.It is a fairly generic element, but still has way more semantic meaning than the plain old &lt;div&gt;. </dd>
               <dt>&lt;nav&gt;:</dt>
               <dd>The &lt;nav&gt; element is for marking up the navigation links or other constructs that will take you to different pages of the current site, or different areas of the current page. Other links, such as sponsored links, do not count. You can of course include headings and other structuring elements inside the &lt;nav&gt;  but it's not compulsory.</dd>
              <dt>&lt;aside&gt;: </dt>
              <dd>you may have noticed that we used an &lt;aside&gt; element to markup the 2nd sidebar: the one containing latest gigs and contact details. This is perfectly appropriate, as &lt;aside&gt;is for marking up pieces of information that are related to the main flow, but don't fit in to it directly. And the main content in this case is all about the band!</dd>
               <dt>&lt;article&gt;: </dt>
               <dd>&lt;article&gt; is related to &lt;section&gt;, but is distinctly different. Whereas &lt;section&gt; is for grouping distinct sections of content or functionality, &lt;article&gt; is for containing related individual standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos, images or news items. Think of it this way - if you have a number of items of content, each of which would be suitable for reading on their own, and would make sense to syndicate as separate items in an RSS feed, then &lt;article&gt; is suitable for marking them up.</dd>

          <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
              <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                 CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other  media
                 CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                 External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>
          <h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
           <p> CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. </p>
           <h3>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
            <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
               HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
               &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
              When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
              To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
              CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
             <h3>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h3>
             <p> The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
              With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>

            <h3>HTML Layout Techniques</h3>
            <p>There are four different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>HTML tables</li>
              <li>CSS float property</li>
              <li>CSS framework</li>
              <li>CSS flexbox</li>
              </ul>
              <dl>
              <dt>HTML Tables</dt>
              <dd>The &lt;table&gt; element was not designed to be a layout tool! The purpose of the &lt;table&gt; element is to display tabular data. So, do not use tables for your page layout! They will bring a mess into your code. And imagine how hard it will be to redesign your site after a couple of months.</dd>
              <dt>CSS Frameworks</dt>
              <dd>If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.</dd>
              <dt>CSS Floats</dt>
              <dd>It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.</dd>
              <dt>CSS Flexbox</dt>
               <dd>Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3.
                   Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. Disadvantages: Does not work in IE10 and earlier.</dd>
